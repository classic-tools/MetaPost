This file describes the installation process for the MetaPost system.
The source files are set up with the web2c version of TeX which is available
by anonymous ftp from the machine labrea.stanford.edu and/or other standard
sites.  The only parts of the web2c distribution that you really need are the
following:
1. An installed executable for TeX with all the .tfm files and everything
   you need to actually run TeX.
2. The actual PASCAL-to-C conversion programs in web2c subdirectory
3. An executable version of tangle (probably in the web subdirectory)
4. Executable versions of tftopl and pltotf from the texware subdirectory
   (used only for the test suite).

Some support is required in the dvi-to-PostScript program in order to take
full advantage of MetaPost's ability to include typeset text in figures.
Rokicki's dvips is one of the few drivers that has this support; it is
also available from labrea.stanford.edu and/or other standard sites.

The main source files for MetaPost are in ./mp; auxiliary programs
that process included TeX commands are contained in ./mpware; standard
macro files and such are in ./mplib.  The ./mp directory actually
contains code for two versions of MetaPost: virmp requires a binary file
giving standard definitions; inimp is a little larger and is capable of
writing such ".mem" files.  This distribution has been set up so that you
can get by with just inimp.  If you do this, the executable should be given
the standard name "mp".  Inimp expects to preload an existing ".mem" file
unless it is invoked with the "-I" switch.  (See the man page.)

When inimp or virmp is processing an input file that contains TeX commands,
they depend on a shell script mpware/makempx to create an auxiliary input file
that gives corresponding MetaPost picture expressions.  This script uses
mpware/mptotex to create TeX input and uses a program mpware/dvitomp to
postprocess the TeX output.

A number of optional files are needed only for troff support:
There is another shell script mpware/troffmpx that handles input files
with imbeded troff commands.  It runs programs mpware/mptotr and mpware/dmp
to generate a troff input file and convert the troff output into MetaPost.
The dmp translator reads data files mplib/trfonts.map and mplib/trchar.adj.
The former handles the translation between troff names and tfm file names,
while the latter gives character positioning adjustments.  There is also
a directory mplib/charlib containing MetaPost programs for characters used
in troff and not appearing in standard PostScript fonts.

Like its ancestor METAFONT, MetaPost is written in the web language.  Anyone
who is not familiar with the mechanics of web programs should see the
documentation that comes with the TeX distribution.  That distribution
contains a directory called "web2c" with Tim Morgan's programs for
automatically translating web programs into C.  It is a good idea to
look at the documentation for web2c before installing MetaPost.  This
distribution does not use the automatic `configure' script found recent
versions of web2c.

The source files expect the web2c directory to have four programs: fixwrites,
regfix, splitup, and web2c.  Each directory that contains web programs
contains a shell script "convert" that invokes the four translation
programs.  It also refers to a .h file and a ".defines" file that tells
how to treat certain identifiers in the Pascal programs.

The ultimate source for MetaPost is mp/mp.web.  System-dependent changes
go in mp/mp.ch.  This is basically a diff file where changes are denoted
                   @x <old text> @y <new text> @z
There are also a number of source files necessary for Pascal-to-C conversion.
The driver file mp/convert uses identifier definitions in mp/mp.def.
The translated C files use definitions in mp/mp.h and external routines
in mp/mpext.c and mp/mpmath.c.  C program files mp0.c through mp9.c and
include files mpd.h and coerce.h are generated automatically by mp/convert.


                            Installation

0. Some parts of the code in mp/mp.web indexed under `system dependencies'.
   This distribution should contain everything necessary to make these
   parts of the program work on UNIX systems, but this is a good place
   to look if something goes wrong.
1. If you don't have tangle version 4.0 or higher, get a more recent TeX
   distribution.
2. Find the directory in the TeX distribution that contains executable
   versions of fixwrites, regfix, splitup, and web2c.  The convert scripts
   in mp and mpware assume that this directory is named web2c and is a
   sibling of mp and mpware.  Make a symbolic link if necessary to achieve
   this.  It is also wise to arrange for a sibling directory web containing
   an executable version of tangle, and a sibling directory texware containing
   executables for tftopl and pltotf.
3. Edit ./site.h and ./Makefile to set up your local paths, compiler, etc.
   Be sure to fix the directory names for `make install' if you want to
   use that feature.  (If your system already has a program named `mp', you
   will have to change mpname in ./Makefile.  Suggested alternative: `mpost'.)
   If you have successfully compiled TeX and METAFONT from the WEB2C sources,
   most of the information can be copied from there:
   A. TEXFONTS, MFINPUTS in	   See ./site.h or lib/site.h in your WEB2C
      ./site.h			   distribution.
   B. MetaPost-specific paths and  Read the comments in ./site.h.
      flags in ./site.h
   C. REGFIX, NONASCII, EDITOR	   See WEB2C:site.h or WEB2C:lib/site.h
      in ./site.h
   D. schar, integer in ./site.h   See WEB2C:site.h or WEB2C:lib/config.h
   E. SIGNAL_HANDLER_RETURN_TYPE   See WEB2C:site.h or WEB2C:lib/c-auto.h
      in ./site.h
   F. BSD, SYSV, POSIX_SOURCE,	   See WEB2C:site.h or read the comments
      ANSI, SIXTEENBIT in ./site.h in ./site.h and decide
   G. CC, OPT, LDFLAGS, install	   Installation directories should agree
      directories in ./Makefile    with paths in ./site.h as explained in
				   the comments in ./Makefile
4. Edit mpware/makempx and mpware/troffmpx to fix MPLIB and PATH as explained
   in the comments at the top of those files.   If you have not set up web
   and texware directories as explained in step 2, you will need to edit
   mp/Makefile and mpware/Makefile to fix TANGLE, TFTOPL, and PLTOTF.
5. [You can skip this step if you are using Rockiki's dvips.]
   Edit mplib/psfonts.map to give the correct tfm file names for builtin
   PostScript fonts.  Each line in mplib/psfonts.map is of the following form:
   TeX-name (without .tfm extension) <spaces> PostScript name [optional junk]
   Fonts not listed in this table are assumed to have PostScript names that
   match their TeX names.
      If you want MetaPost to work with troff any changes to the first column
   of mplib/psfonts.map will have to be reflected in the third column of
   the mplib/trfonts.map table.  (Columns in this table are separated by
   one or more tabs).  The first column is the troff name, the second column
   is the PostScript name and the third is the tfm name without the directory
   or .tfm suffix.  When there is no entry in the third column, the second
   column is used.
6. Run the `trap' test by making `run-triptrap' in the top-level directory.
   It is unnecessary (but harmless) to make `triptrap' first.  The trap test
   includes a series of diff commands that compare the results with what is
   expected.  It is normal to have some differences since  many of the output
   files contain a line that gives the date and time.  Certain other differences
   are allowed as explained in mp/trapdir/README.  Don't bother to make
   `clean-triptrap'--it is no longer necessary.
7. Type `make' (in the top-level directory) to make the working versions of
   every program in this hierarchy.  This also makes the plain.mem and
   mfplain.mem.  (These are analogous to METAFONT's plain.base).  It is normal
   to get one warning message from the C compiler about an unreached statement.
8. `make install' to do the obvious.  If you don't want troff support, make
   `tex-install' instead.
9. `make clean' if you intend to compile the programs on another
   architecture.  Since the .c files are intended to be portable across
   architectures, they are not removed by this.
10.`make veryclean' when you're all done.  This removes everything that
    was not in the original distribution (and more besides).
11. Install the man page doc/mp.1 where appropriate.  If in Step 2, you
    changed mpname in ./Makefile or if you changed MPINPUTS, MPPOOL, MPMEM,
    MPXCOMMAND, or TROFFMPX in ./site.h, the man page will need updating.
    Most likely, this will mean replacing all occurrences of `/usr/lib/mp'
    with something else.
12. Make sure the complete system works.  `cd doc; mp manfig' should produce
    about 50 output files manfig.0 ... manfig.411.  Then mpman.dvi can be
    printed in the usual fashion and dvips should be able to merge in the
    figures.  If you have troff support, that can be tested with doc/figs.mp
    and doc/demo.ms. Then `cd doc; mp -T figs' produces figs.1, and
    `troff -ms demo.ms' produces troff output that refers to figs.1 and
    can be printed in the usual fashion.
